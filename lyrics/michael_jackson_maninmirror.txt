Title: Man in the Mirror
Mm-mm, oh
I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good, gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar of my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street without enough to eat
Who am I to be blind? Pretending not to see their need
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, you know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana, oh-oh
I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan, could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream (Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind, you see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (You)
I'm asking him to change his ways (You)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (You)
I'm asking him to change his ways (You)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Oh, yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (To change)
And no message could have been any clearer (Ooh, ooh)
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change (Come on!)
You got to get it right while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your your mind (Your mind)
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Oh, yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (To change)
And no message could have been any clearer (Ooh, ooh)
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
Stand up
Stand up (Make that change)
Stand up and lift, yourself now
Man in the mirror
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Make that change (Stand up, stand up)
You know, you know
You know (Man in the mirror)
Change
Make that change
