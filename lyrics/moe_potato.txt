Song Title: Spine of a dog
You say potato and I say three
You say potato and I say three
You say potato and I say three
You say potato and I say three
You say potato and I say three
I am a pinball machine.
I can't tell the difference between
my bellybutton or navel
pingpong, pool cue, or a foosball table
Why is it you ask me why
I don't know the answer
Why is it you ask me why
I don't know the answer
Why is it you ask me why
I don't transmit what hits my eye
We're the same, yeah you and me
except you say potato and I say three
I'm thinking of what I'd rather be
parameceum is lookin' pretty good to me
I'd be so small you could not see
I could still be your worst enemy
I am a pinball machine.
I can't tell the difference between
my bellybutton or navel
pingpong, pool cue, or a foosball table
