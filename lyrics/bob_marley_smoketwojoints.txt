Title: Smoke Two Joints
I smoke two joints in the morning
I smoke two joints at night
I smoke two joints in the afternoon
And it makes me feel alright

Smoke two joints in time of peace
Into the time of war
Smoke two joints before I smoke two joints
And then I smoke some more

Yeah, that's what I do, hey

Mama she always told me, "Son you really have it bad"
Mama she always told me, "Son you do the best you can"
Then one day I met a man, she came to me and said
"I work good and I work fine but first take care of him"

I smoke two joints in the morning
I smoke two joints at night
I smoke two joints in the video game
And it makes me feel alright

I smoke two joints in time of peace
Into the time of war
Smoke two joints before I smoke two joints
And then I smoke some more

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

One peace, one time
Funny days, funny days
Gimme that bassline
Fellas, fellas
