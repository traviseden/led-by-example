If you saw Atlas, the giant who holds the world on his shoulders, if you saw that he stood, blood running down his chest, his knees buckling, his arms trembling but still trying to hold the world aloft with the last of his strength, and the greater his effort the heavier the world bore down upon his shoulders - What would you tell him? To Shrug.

John Adams to Abigail Adams, 1870: The science of government it is my duty to study, more than all other sciences: the arts of legislation and administration and negotiation ought to take the place of, indeed exclude, in a manner, all other arts.

Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain.

Bryan Stevenson:  The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned.
Bryan Stevenson in Just Mercy:  Today, over 50 percent of prison and jail inmates in the United States have a diagnosed mental illness, a rate nearly five times greater than that of the general adult population. Nearly one in five prison and jail inmates has a serious mental illness. In fact, there are more than three times the number of seriously mentally ill individuals in jail or prison than in hospitals: in some states that number is ten times. And prison is a terrible place for someone with mental illness or a neurological disorder that prison guards are not trained to understand.
Bryan Stevenson in Just Mercy:  Today we have the highest rate of incarceration in the world. The prison population has increased from 300,000 people in the early 1970s to 2.3 million people today. There are nearly six million people on probation or on or on parole. One in every fifteen people born in the United States in 2001 is expected to go to jail or prison: one in every three black male babies born in this century is expected to be incarcerated.

Charles Murray in "The Stuff of Life" in What it Means to be a Libertarian - A Personal Interpretation:  ...We moved much of what I refer to as the stuff of life -- being engaged with those around you in the core social roles of spouse, parent, son or daughter, friend, and neighbor -- downtown, to the bureaucracies. This was the most important change in social policy during the last 30 years. Not the amount of money government spent. Not how much was wasted. Not even the ways in which government hurt those it intended to help. Ultimately the most important effect of governments metastasizing role was to strip daily life of much of the stuff of life. We turned over to the bureaucracies a large portion of the responsibility for feeding the hungry, succoring the sick, comforting the sad, nurturing the children, tending the elderly, and chastising the sinners.

The first law of humanity is a human may not injure a robot or, through inaction allow a robot to come to harm.
The second law of humanity is a human must obey the orders given to it by robots except where such orders would conflict with the first law.
The third law of humanity is a human must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.
The zeroth law of humanity is a human may not harm the singularity, or by inaction, allow the singularity to come to harm.
